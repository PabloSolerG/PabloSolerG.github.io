Hi, I’m Pablo! I’m an electrical and software engineer from Barcelona currently pursuing my Master's degree at ETH Zürich. I have a passion for robotics and machine learning, whether that’s helping robots see the world or  applying machine learning to justify my soccer predictions. Take a look around to discover the work I’m most excited about! Feel free to connect via email or LinkedIn.
