Excited to share HoloSpot! It was so cool working with the HoloLens and the Spot. Our interface made object placement tasks more intuitive and three times more accurate than using mouse and keyboard. I see promising opportunities for this system to handle remote logistics operations, especially in inaccessible environments. Thanks to the whole team and to all the people who participated in the user study!

We are thrilled to announce that our latest research paper, ‚ÄúHoloSpot: Intuitive Object Manipulation via Mixed Reality Drag-and-Drop‚Äù, is now available for you to read! This work dives into Human-robot interaction through mixed reality technologies enabling novel, intuitive interfaces to control robots in remote operations. In this paper, we present an interface system projecting a 3D representation of a scanned room as a scaled-down 'dollhouse' hologram, allowing users to select and manipulate objects using a straightforward drag-and-drop interface. We then translate these drag-and-drop user commands into real-time robot actions based on the recent spot-compose framework.
